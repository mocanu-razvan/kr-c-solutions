 * Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly
 * print the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of
 * the text.
 */

/*
 * NOTE: Reading the requirement carefuly leads me to believe the authors
 * were hinting at revising the main() function since they mention printing
 * and counting the total length of the text, operations which the getline()
 * function most certainly shouldn't do.
 *
 * In the first version I did just this, but then I observed that
 * information relating to where a line should end leaked out from
 * getline() into main().
 *
 * Reconsidering a better solution, I ended up modifying getline()
 * which leads to a clean solution that separates the concerns of
 * the functions.
 *
 * Also, it turns out it's best to include a newline character at the end of
 * the line, even if the line array is not big enough to hold the entire line,
 * because the purpose of the getline() function is to do a best effort to
 * acquire a line and its users expect lines terminated with newline characters.
 * Otherwise, unintuitive logic would have to be put in main() to determine
 * if the line contains a newline character or not.
